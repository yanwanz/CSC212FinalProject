# CSC212 Final Project

## Motivation
Given a complex statement in Basic Sentential Logic, there are many possibilities of the truth value of this statement, based on different combinations of truth and falsity of its parts (or inputs). Truth table is a good way to list out these possibilities of truth values so that expressions in Basic Sentential can be completely analyzed. Although truth tables are very useful, it takes too much time for us to draw by hand, especially when the input variables are more than 3. Therefore, using a computer program to compute truth values and then draw a truth table makes this process more efficient.

## Features
* A truth table generator for basic sentential propositions.
* Only supports conjunction, disjunction, and negation.
